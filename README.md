There is a need for health policy research on alcohol promotion and marketing. The global exposure to alcohol marketing requires a robust policy response, especially to protect young and u nderage people. 

The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) is often cited as an appropriate global governance model to control alcohol marketing. 
Yet policy action on alcohol marketing remains weak or non-existent globally with social marketing typically unregulated. 
Alcohol consumption is rising fastest in Asia while aggressive industry marketing has particularly targeted the growing population in lower- and middle-income countries. 

The study findings will help to formulate evidence-based health policy for alcohol marketing such as legislation of content on digital platforms and developing public health counter-marketing.
